# Attention-based interpretability

Each script is numbered with the orden of execution. Also, there are two Colab notebooks to be run, their order is also determined by their number on the prefix of the name.

1) Script to generate the dataset, performing pre-processing and datasets splitting.
2) Notebook to perform the stance classification and save the fine-tuned trained classification models.
3) [Colab environment for obtaining the attention weights](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wN4x3iGvrIkxQKT8OELWYStw7O4I2lMg?usp=sharing)
4) [Colab environment for obtaining the topic words (Exp. 3)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1whGJKJiygnyp0SI69y0yR--pq2fTTGQb?usp=sharing)
5) Notebook to obtain the Captum model weights/score for the test datasets words.
6) Script to calculate the different words weights for the experiments.
7) Notebook to perform the leave-one-out experiments.
8) Script to calculate the metrics values for the experiments.
9) Script to perform the statistical tests over the words metrics.
